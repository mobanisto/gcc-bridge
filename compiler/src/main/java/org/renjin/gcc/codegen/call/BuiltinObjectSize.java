/**
 * Built-in construct that returns a constant number of bytes from ptr to the end of the object ptr pointer points to
 * (if known at compile time).
 *
 * __builtin_object_size never evaluates its arguments for side-effects. If there are any side-effects in them,
 * it returns (size_t) -1 for type 0 or 1 and (size_t) 0 for type 2 or 3.
 *
 * If there are multiple objects ptr can point to and all of them are known at compile time, the returned number is
 * the maximum of remaining byte counts in those objects if type & 2 is 0 and minimum if nonzero. If it is not possible
 * to determine which objects ptr points to at compile time, __builtin_object_size should return (size_t) -1 for type 0
 * or 1 and (size_t) 0 for type 2 or 3.
 *
 * type is an integer constant from 0 to 3. If the least significant bit is clear, objects are whole variables, if
 * it is set, a closest surrounding subobject is considered the object a pointer points to. The second bit determines
 * if maximum or minimum of remaining bytes is computed.
